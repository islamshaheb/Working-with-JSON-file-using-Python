I choose Python to complete my task.
As python has some built-in library for handling 
Json file and easy to maintain.That's why I choose python.

First of all, I take two Date as User input to find out the activeness of a user.
And I have to repeat this untill I enter a valid date which is in the data.

Then I have to take the user id to find out the result. It must be an integer.
If the user id is wrong then the program will set a user id (File Id) manually.

After that, program will convert the date string into time format and calculate
the total number of meals in this specific period of time and find out the active threshold of a user
and will show output. 

There are other options to see all dates, all meals in a day. These options are commented .
We need to comment out to work with these options.
